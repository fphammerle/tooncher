## Unreleased

## [1.0.3] - 2020-06-18
### Fixed
- compatibility with python3.5:
  - fixed `TypeError` due to `start_engine` passing `pathlib.Path`
    to `subprocess.Popen` for `cwd`
  - tests: fixed `AttributeError` due to unavailable `MagicMock.assert_called_once`
  - tests: fixed `FileNotFoundError` due to strict `pathlib.Path.resolve`

## [1.0.2] - 2020-05-05
### Fixed
- change user agent to workaround blacklisting of "Python-urllib/3.*"
  (HTTP403, cloudflare error 1010, https://github.com/fphammerle/tooncher/issues/2)

## [1.0.1] - 2019-12-27
### Added
- package: use readme as long description for pypi.org

### Fixed
- `test_start_engine_mac` if `os.environ != {}`

## [1.0.0] - 2019-12-23
### Added
- path to tootown engine may be provided via env var `$TOONCHER_ENGINE_PATH`

### Changed
- command line interface:
  - fail if selected username was not found in config
  - fail if selected username has multiple entries in config
  - install via `setuptools.setup(entry_points=…)`
- python interface:
  - now private:
    - `tooncher.LOGIN_API_URL`
    - `tooncher.LoginDelayed`
    - `tooncher.LoginSuccessful`
    - `tooncher.TOONTOWN_ENGINE_DEFAULT_PATH`
    - `tooncher.api_request`
    - `tooncher.login`
  - `start_engine` & `launch`: expects `isinstance(engine_path, pathlib.Path)`
    (instead of `str`)
- pass all env vars to engine
  (e.g., enables use of `optirun tooncher …`)

### Removed

  - `argcomplete`
